# DSA

**Some common patterns**

- If input array is sorted then => Binary search, 2-pointers.
- If asked for all permutation/subset then => Backtracking
- If given a tree OR graph => BFS, DFS
- If given a linked list => 2-pointers
- If recursion is banned => Stack
- If must solve in-place then => Swap corresponding values, store 1 or more diff values in same pointer
- If asked for max,min suarray/subset/options then => DP
- If asked for top/least K items then => Heap, QuickSelect
- If asked for common string => map, trie

### Alog

**Easy :** BFS, DFS, (linear search, binary search, jump search), bubble sort, insertion sort, redix sort, counting sort, bucket sort, traversal(preorder, inorder, postorder), 2-Pointer, slow-fast pointer, greedy algo, divide & conquer.

**Intermediate :** Dijkstra's algo, Floyd-warshell algorithm, Bellmen-ford algo, Kruskal's algo, prim's algo, Hamming dist, suffix tree, Rabin-Karp algo, Floyd's cycle detection algo, Topological sorting, quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, sliding window tech, backtracking, kadane's algo(max subarray sum), spanning tree, longest incresing subsequence(LIS)

**Hard :** DP, Bit manipulation techniques, string manipulation (longest common subsequence), 0/1 knapsack.
