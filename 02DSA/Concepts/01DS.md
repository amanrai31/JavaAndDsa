# Data structures

Data structures are ways to store and organize data so you can use it efficiently. An array is an example of a DS, which allows multiple elements to be stored in a single variable.Java includes many other data structures as well, in the java.util package.

Some of the most common are:

- ArrayList
- HashSet
- HashMap

1. ArrayList
An ArrayList is a resizable array that can grow as needed.
```java
// Import the ArrayList class
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();
    cars.add("Volvo");
    cars.add("BMW");
    cars.add("Ford");
    cars.add("Mazda");
    System.out.println(cars);
  }
}
```
