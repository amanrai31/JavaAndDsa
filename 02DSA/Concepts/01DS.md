# Data structures

Data structures are ways to store and organize data so you can use it efficiently. An array is an example of a DS, which allows multiple elements to be stored in a single variable.Java includes many other data structures as well, in the java.util package.

Some of the most common are:

- ArrayList
- Queue
- HashSet
- HashMap
- Tree
- Graph

### Iterators

An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet.

**METHODS =>** hasNext() || next() || remove()

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<>();
    cars.add("Mahindra");
    cars.add("BMW");
    cars.add("Ford");

    Iterator<String> it = cars.iterator();       // Iterator for arrayList car.
    while (it.hasNext()) {
    String car = it.next();                      // Each time you call it.next(), moves the iterator one step forward.
    if (car.equals("Ford")) {
        it.remove();
    } else {
        System.out.println(car);
    }
}
  }
}

```

**NOTE :** Trying to remove items using a for loop or a for-each loop would not work correctly because the collection is changing size at the same time that the code is trying to loop.

**NOTE :** Never use == for string comparison in Java. Use .equals() instead because .equals() checks content only AND  `==` checks if both variables point to the same object in memory.
