# CONTENT => COLLECTIONS

The Java Collections Framework provides a set of interfaces (like List, Set, and Map) and a set of classes (ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.) that implement those interfaces. All of these are part of the java.util package.

**Tip =>** Think of the Collections Framework as a toolbox. Interfaces like List define what tools can do, and classes like ArrayList are the actual tools that do the work.

Collection framework made up of => 1. Collection interface, 2. Map interface, 3. Iterator interface

Collection interface => List<E>, Set<E>, Queue<E>
