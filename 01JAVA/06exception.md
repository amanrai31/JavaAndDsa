# CONTENT => EXCEPTIONS

Exceptions are unexpected event occurs at runtime. Can be handled. Two types => 1. Checked execption(compile time). 2. Unchecked execption(runtime)

Error => Indicate serious problem beyond of control & irrecoverable (e.g. jvm running out of memory, memory leak, infinite recurrsion) 

Exception handling => Handling runtime error to preserve regular flow of program. When an exception occurs within a method, it creates an obj(exception obj) containing all info about that exception such as name,description, & state of program.
