# CONTENT => OOPS => CLASS, OBJECT

### OOP

In Object oriented programming (OOP), we treat everything as an object. Main aim is to bind data and f/n(that operate on data) together into a single unit(class). 


**USE :** Better code structure + Maintainability + Scalability + Reusability

We will be covering => `class`, `object`, `Inheritance`, `polymorphism`, `encapsulation`, `Abstraction`

#### Prerequisite => Access modifiers

- public => accessible from any class
- protected => accessible within the package in which it is defined & in it's subclass/childClass ( including outside the package )
- default => Package protected
- private => accessible only within the defined class.

### Class

Class is a blueprint/prototype, from which objects are created. It is set of fields/props & methods. We can consider as user-defined data types.

**NOTE :** Only one class can be public in a package.

Class Declaration =>

1. Modifiers => Class can have only `pulic` OR `default` access.
2. class name => First letter Capital(recommended)
3. superclass (if any) => use keyword `extend`
4. interface (if any) => A comma seperated list of interface(s) (if any), use keyword `implements`
5. Body => {}

**Type of class used in real time application =>** `Nested class`, `annonymous class`, `lambda expression`

### Object

Object is building block of OOPs. An object is made up of => 
1. field/props/instance variable => Reflect properties of an object
2. methods/functions => Reflects behaviour of object
3. Identity => Unique name to object, enalble one object to interact with other.

#### Declare & initalization of object

Declare => `Cars m5cs;` => Value will be null, declareing a reference variable does not create an object.

Initalization => A `new` operator instantiate the class by allocating memory for new object & return ref to that memory, `new` operator also invokes the class constructor. `Cars m5cs = new Cars();` => There are 3 other way to create obj from a class
