### field vs variable

- Field(class-level) => A variable declared inside a class, but outside any method, constructor, or block. It can be instance or static.
- Variable(general-term) => Any named storage location in Java: includes fields, local variables, parameters, etc.

**So, all fields are variables, but not all variables are fields.**
